# PHP Monitor Self-Updater

This is the source code of the PHP Monitor Self-Updater app, which is included in PHP Monitor 5.8 and newer. 

> **Note** This is a temporary repository, as this source code will be included in the 6.x development branch on the [main repository](https://github.com/nicoverbruggen/phpmon) in the future.

Please note that this repository does not include the Xcode project file. You will have to manually create a new target and assign `main.swift` to be the entry point of the new Swift application.

If you want reproducable builds, I recommend waiting until the first 6.0 DEV release, which will include the full project with updater included.
